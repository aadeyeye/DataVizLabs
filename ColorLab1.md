Q2.1a) What dataset is the figure visualizing? 
The dataset is visualizing the closeness of a particular cluster to its cluster center. It is showing how uniform a cluster group is getting to a certain destination at a certain time, depending on the day of the week and the month of the year.

Q2.1b) Which marks and which channels are used in this visualization? 
Block size, length and color are used in this visualization

Q2.1c) Which data attribute is being represented by each channel? 
Proximity to cluster central is being represented by each channel


Q2.2 a) Which color deficiencies (if any) make it difficult to make out the “morning commute pattern”, making the first and second weekday daily time periods appear more or less indistinguishable? 
The monochromatic view, otherwise know as achromatopsia is the most indistinguishable visual for the chart. 

Q2.2 b) Which color deficiencies (if any) make out the “Fall season shift”?  
Blue-blind/tritanopia and blue-weak/tritanomoly make out the “Fall season shift”.

Q2.3 Test yourself. Based on the red and green blocks on the right, complete the matching exercise below to predict the blocks will appear for each deficiency. Upon completion, check your responses in Coblis and discuss any discrepancies.

Q3.1 Reflect on your experience with using the tool and the ramps you created. 
I used a bathymetric image from the QGIS lab to observe the ColorMoves App features. Changing the color ramps and observing the color concentrations provide insight on which colors 
are best fit to convey a message in your visualization by focusing on saturation, luminance and the type of image itself.
