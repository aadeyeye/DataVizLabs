Illustration of a flight route at 3 locations in the United States. QGIS features like drop shadow and outer glow were used to illuminate the plane-like points and have them appear to "pop out" of the screen.

Blending of a road network in the U.S. The 'Addition' feature was used here. Addition in QGIS indicates that the more layers overlap, which may mean a complex road network depending on the zoom, the closer to 255 RGB value there is.

 A digital elevation model (DEM) can be seen here. Polygons are superimposed over a DEM hillshade but both are blended so that the hillshade is apparent and the polygon colors are not washed out.

A series of bathymetric layers from the Natural Earth Dataset. The draw affects feature is used in QGIS to illustrate the differences in water levels. The 'Multiply' feature is used to provide a shaded relief on the land.

In QGIS, you can create a 'shapeburst'-like appearance on the map by overlapping identical layers and adjusting the colors on one layer while adjusting the fill and opacity of another layer.
